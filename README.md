- We are currently presenting a demo.

  Users simply need to enter the name of the desired functional space name in the search box, such as bedroom, bathroom or living room, and the demo will automatically identify the corresponding functional space in the model and highlight it.

- Download and run locally

  Of course you can also download it locally and run it with a local HTTP server using `<Python>`. Start the HTTP server in the project's root directory:

  `<python -m http.server 8008>`

  Accessed through a web browser:

  `<http://localhost:8008/index.html>`
